# Gravitational Acceleration Calculator in Java

## 📌 Description

This is a simple Java console program that calculates the gravitational acceleration (`g`) at a given height above the Earth's surface. The user is prompted to enter a height (in meters), and the program outputs the corresponding gravitational acceleration based on Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

## 🧪 Formula Used

The formula used in the program is:

g = (G * M) / (R + h)²

Where:  
- `G` = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg² (gravitational constant)  
- `M` = 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg (mass of the Earth)  
- `R` = 6.371 × 10⁶ m (radius of the Earth)  
- `h` = height above Earth's surface (input from user)  
- `g` = gravitational acceleration at height `h`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file named `Gravitacija.java`.
3. Open a terminal and compile the program:
javac Gravitacija.java
4. Run the compiled class:
java Gravitacija
5. Enter the height when prompted (e.g., `0`, `1000`, `1000000`).

## 📄 Example Output

Vnesete visina (v metrih)

1000000

Pospesek je enak: 7.337700 m/s^2

Visina je enaka: 1000000 m
